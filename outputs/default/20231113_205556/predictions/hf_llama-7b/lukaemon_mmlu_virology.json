The first group of pathologists is aware of the race of the patient from whom the biopsy came, while the second group is blinded as to the patient’s race. The first group reports ‘hypertensive nephropathy’ much more frequently for black patients than the second group. Which of the following types of bias is most likely present in this study?\nA. Confounding\nB. Nonresponse bias\nC. Recall bias\nD. Referral bias\nAnswer: D",

Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5 years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000 women. The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude:\nA. There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.\nB. Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.\nC. Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.\nD. There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.\nAnswer: D",
