You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thouroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
11/13 23:14:42 - OpenCompass - WARNING - pad_token_id is not set for the tokenizer.
11/13 23:14:42 - OpenCompass - WARNING - Using eos_token_id </s> as pad_token_id.
