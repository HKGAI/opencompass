There are 3 links (2 intermediate nodes) between server and client and each has a transmission rate of 10Mbps. Given that the segment size is 15 Kbytes, the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is 30ms, the initial slow-start threshold is 8 and the client's buffer has a storage space of 150 K bytes. Assume that TCP Reno is used, there is no loss during transmission and the headers of protocols are ignored.

The film consists of silver iodide crystals, Poisson distributed, with a density of 100 particles per unit area. The film is illuminated without knowledge of the position of the silver iodide particles. It is then developed and the receiver sees only the silver iodide particles that have been illuminated. It is assumed that light incident on a cell exposes the grain if it is there and otherwise results in a blank response. Silver iodide particles that are not illuminated and vacant portions of the film remain blank. We make the following assumptions: We grid the film very finely into cells of area $dA$. It is assumed that there is at most one silver iodide particle per cell and that no silver iodide particle is intersected by the cell boundaries.

Your father-in-law (mass 95.0 kg) stands on a platform 45.0 m above the ground, and one end of the cord is tied securely to his ankle and the other end to the platform. You have promised him that when he steps off the platform he will fall a maximum distance of only 41.0 m before the cord stops him. You had several bungee cords to select from, and you tested them by stretching them out, tying one end to a tree, and pulling on the other end with a force of 380.0 N.
