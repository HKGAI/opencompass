Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\nA. If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\nD. If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\nAnswer: D",

This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references.

This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references.

This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references.

This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references.

During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references.

The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\nA. 5\nB. 6\nC. 7\nD. 9\nAnswer: D\n\nConsider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\nA. 1/50\nB. 1/27\nC. 1/25\nD. 2/27\nAnswer: B\n\nArray A contains 256 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 4,096.\nArray B contains 512 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 8,192.\nAssume that only arrays A and B can be cached in an initially empty, physically addressed, physically tagged, direct-mapped, 2K-byte cache with an 8-byte block size. The following loop is then executed.\nfor (i = 0; i < 256; i++)\n        A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];\nDuring the execution of the loop, how many bytes will be written to memory if the cache has a write-through policy?\nA. 0\nB. 256\nC. 1024\nD. 2048\nAnswer: D",

The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\nA. 5\nB. 6\nC. 7\nD. 9\nAnswer: D\n\nConsider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\nA. 1/50\nB. 1/27\nC. 1/25\nD. 2/27\nAnswer: B\n\nSuppose that a certain software product has a mean time between failures of 10,000 hours and has a mean time to repair of 20 hours.
